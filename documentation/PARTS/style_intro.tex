\section{Introduction}
This document contains a very basic summary and guideline to what is considered
{\glqq good practice\grqq} or {\glqq good codingstyle\grqq} for this project.
This is done for two reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Future me working on the code surely has forgotten what present me
        consideres good code and this is a way of reminding future me.
    \item In the case of multiple contributers I want to help in keeping the
        code as uniform as possible.
\end{itemize}

Following, I will give a brief overview of what tools I use and how I define
good quality code. The list will surely be incomplete and I'm not entirely sure
if I will ever be able to complete it. But additions will be made if needed and
requested.
